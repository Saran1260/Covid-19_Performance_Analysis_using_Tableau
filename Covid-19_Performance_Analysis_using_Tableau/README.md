### Project 4: Covid-19 Performance Analysis

**Objective:**
The project aimed to develop an interactive Tableau dashboard to support decision-makers in evaluating how effectively individual states and Union Territories (UTs) managed the Covid-19 pandemic. By comparing metrics such as confirmed percentage, deceased percentage, and recovered percentage, the analysis sought to provide actionable insights into recovery performance and overall management strategies.

**Key Features and Deliverables:**

1. **Top 10 States by Recovery Performance (Bar Chart):**  
   A bar chart was designed to showcase the top 10 states with the highest recovery rates. The data was sorted in descending order, enabling users to quickly identify which states excelled in terms of recovery. This visualization serves as a primary tool for assessing state-level pandemic management.

2. **Top 5 States for Recovery Performance (Pie Chart):**  
   A pie chart was created to highlight the top 5 states with the best recovery rates. This visual representation provides a succinct overview of the leading performers in pandemic recovery, making it easy to grasp at a glance.

3. **Performance Over Time (Line-Bar Combo Chart):**  
   A combined line and bar chart was developed to show trends over time. This chart uses a column (bar) chart to display the confirmed percentage and a line chart to illustrate the recovered percentage. It focuses exclusively on states with strong recovery performance, enabling users to track recovery trends against confirmed cases across different time periods. This detailed comparison offers a deeper understanding of how recovery evolved in high-performing regions.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**
- **Tableau Public 2024.3.0**: For creating the interactive dashboard and data visualizations.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data preprocessing, filtering, and sorting.
- **Microsoft PowerPoint**: For presenting findings and insights.
- **Data Visualization Techniques**: To design intuitive and informative visual elements.
- **Interactive Dashboard Development**: To enable dynamic filtering and real-time data exploration.

**Outcome:**
The Tableau dashboard provided a comprehensive and visually engaging analysis of Covid-19 recovery performance. It empowered stakeholders to:
- Compare recovery performance among states and UTs.
- Identify best-performing regions through clear and concise visualizations.
- Analyze recovery trends over time relative to confirmed case percentages.

By consolidating and visualizing key metrics, the dashboard enabled data-driven decision-making and facilitated a deeper understanding of recovery strategies. Stakeholders could quickly pinpoint successful management approaches and explore detailed statistics for further insights. This project underscored the importance of effective data visualization in public health management and highlighted the potential of interactive dashboards in driving informed decisions during a crisis.
